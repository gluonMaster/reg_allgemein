## First email verification and welcome delivery — 2026-09-03

Result: `success`. The owner personally opened the existing verification link
once and reported both the successful portal message and receipt of the expected
welcome email. The additional one-welcome permission is consumed. No link replay,
resend, registration retry, login, bootstrap, deploy or configuration mutation
was performed before the bounded reconciliation.

At `17:02:23Z`, the protected single observation confirmed the exact reviewed
Worker fingerprint `ad3134edb662` at 100% traffic with unchanged bindings,
feature gates, Cron schedules and recipient hashes. Its 11 SELECT statements
read 54 rows, wrote 0 and reported `changes=0`, `changed_db=false`; ledger remains
exact `0001`–`0026`, pending 0.

The one account is now an active, unblocked, verified parent with exactly one
FamilyID. Its one email-verification token is used; unused count is zero; there
is exactly one verification commit. The email outbox contains exactly one
terminal `auth.email_verification` and one terminal `auth.welcome`: each has
attempts 1, provider receipt 1 and no safe error code. Audit contains exactly one
`auth.registration_created` and one `auth.email_verified`. Privacy acceptance
remains exactly one. Sessions, admins/bootstrap, Telegram outbox/attempts and
storage intents remain zero. Both fixed cadence rows were successful with no
recent failures. No identity value, password, token/link, cookie or raw provider
identifier was queried or stored.

Protected current-user-only ignored evidence:
`tmp/first-registration-20260903-owner/after-verification-safe.json`, SHA-256
`5854946c323032b4e42a3b74f983aade14b8ede3c6b7326047ed3b9ecac9094d`.

Containment: do not replay the verification link, resend, register again,
bootstrap or perform unrelated actions. The next atomic action is exactly one
owner login with the same account under prompt 04 authorization, followed by
one bounded read-only reconciliation and docs-only checkpoint before logout.

Validation remains docs-only: `npm run docs:check`, `npm run release:scan` and
`git diff --check`. Runtime/config are unchanged; full suite and independent
review are inherited and not repeated. `rollover_required: no`;
`recommended_next_session_mode: High` because the authorized login/session
mutation, postcondition and containment are known.

## Welcome-delivery permission checkpoint — 2026-09-03

The owner explicitly authorized exactly one automatic `auth.welcome` delivery
to the same allowlisted recipient after personally opening the existing
verification link once. The authorization does not permit a resend, second link
open/retry, second account, registration retry, login, bootstrap, unrelated
provider send, deploy or configuration mutation. No remote mutation or provider
send was attempted while recording this permission.

The next atomic action is the owner's single personal opening of the existing
verification link. The link/token must not be shared in chat or evidence. After
the visible result and expected welcome delivery, run the prepared single
bounded `after-verification` reconciliation and create its docs-only checkpoint
before login. Failed or ambiguous verification is not retried blindly.

This is a permission-only docs update. Existing target/candidate/registration
postconditions remain the current bounded evidence; no additional D1, analytics
or health read is justified before the immediate supervised action.
`rollover_required: no`; `recommended_next_session_mode: High` because the next
linked verification/provider mutation and its containment are known.

## First controlled registration and verification delivery — 2026-09-03

Result: `success`. The owner submitted the authorized synthetic registration
form exactly once and reported receipt of its verification email. The bounded
read-only reconciliation completed at `16:50:10Z` against the recorded preview
target and confirmed the expected reviewed Worker fingerprint `ad3134edb662` at
100% traffic, unchanged bindings/feature gates/Cron schedules and the same two
recipient hashes. Registration permission is consumed; there was no retry,
resend, second account, bootstrap, deploy or configuration mutation.

The 11 SELECT statements read 49 rows, wrote 0 and reported `changes=0`,
`changed_db=false`. The exact ledger remains `0001`–`0026`, pending 0. Before →
after counts are: users/parents `0 → 1`, privacy acknowledgements `0 → 1`,
unused unexpired email-verification tokens `0 → 1`, and register rate-limit
buckets `0 → 1` with consumed count 1. The sole account is active, unblocked,
unverified and has no FamilyID before verification, as required. The sole outbox
row is `auth.email_verification`, terminal `sent`, attempts 1, provider receipt
1 and no safe error code. Audit contains exactly one
`auth.registration_created`. Verification commits, sessions, admins/bootstrap,
Telegram outbox/attempts and storage intents remain zero. Both fixed cadence
rows were successful with no recent failures. No PII, password, token/link,
cookie or raw provider identifier was read or saved.

The owner reported that the successful German confirmation is rendered inside
the now-cleared registration form and can initially look like an error. This is
`P2-REG-UX-001`: the registration flow succeeded and the message is explicit,
but a visually separate success panel or success state would reduce uncertainty.
Per the current prompt, no runtime/UI code is changed and this P2 does not open
a new review loop or block the next manual-preview step.

Protected current-user-only ignored evidence:
`tmp/first-registration-20260903-owner/after-registration-safe.json`, SHA-256
`50fdfc0e9cb7c0d65fc9c63f2d26641d9cf6059a8999db196b8e6d9ba4c79f22`.
An attempted helper invocation after the evidence already existed stopped at
its local one-observation guard before any Cloudflare call; no duplicate remote
read or mutation occurred.

Containment: do not click the verification link, resend, repeat registration,
log in or perform another mutation before the docs-only checkpoint and explicit
authorization for the one automatically enqueued `auth.welcome` delivery. A
failed or ambiguous future verification is reconciled once and never retried
blindly. Access and recipient restrictions remain unchanged.

Validation for this operational checkpoint is limited to `npm run docs:check`,
`npm run release:scan` and `git diff --check`. Runtime, migrations, dependencies
and config are unchanged, so the existing full release gate and independent GO
are reused; full check/Vitest/E2E/build/audit/review are not repeated.
`rollover_required: no`; `recommended_next_session_mode: High`: the next
verification mutation and its automatic welcome send have a known target,
postcondition and containment, but the additional provider delivery requires
explicit permission.

## First registration preflight and owner handoff — 2026-09-03

Result: read-only preflight `success`; registration **not attempted**. The owner
invoked prompt 04, authorizing one first synthetic-parent registration, one
allowlisted verification delivery, then verification/login/logout. This
authorization is retained; it does not authorize a retry, second account,
bootstrap, unrelated provider send, configuration change or deploy. No remote
mutation or provider send was attempted by this session. The last atomic
mutation remains the successful Worker deploy recorded below.

At `16:31:39Z`, the bounded preflight confirmed candidate
`0db38842524ebc146eaa56a9d089e3c3484bf0f3`, deployed fingerprint `ad3134edb662`,
one active version at 100%, exact candidate annotation, unchanged protected
config/bindings/feature gates and both Cron schedules. The account/Worker/origin/
D1 fingerprints match the machine-readable record. Anonymous/invalid Access
probes returned login redirects `302`, valid root and registration GET returned
`200`, and the versioned route remained `404`. Both approved recipient hashes
are unchanged; their sanitized prefixes are `f229bcd52c21` and `04c5a3377cd9`.

One account-wide analytics observation at `16:31:37Z` reported 941,785 reads and
25,718 writes. The subsequent 11 SELECT statements read 47 rows, wrote 0 and
all reported `changes=0`, `changed_db=false`. Ledger names exactly match local
`0001`–`0026`, pending 0. Users/parents/admins/verified users, privacy
acknowledgements, auth tokens/verification commits, outbox/provider receipts,
sessions, auth rate buckets/audit, bootstrap, Telegram and storage intents were
all zero. Both fixed cadence rows were fresh and successful with no recent
failures. Prior scoped integrity/FK evidence is reused; neither historical-job
scans nor full integrity checks were repeated.

**Scope boundary discovered before submission:** successful initial email
verification unconditionally enqueues `auth.welcome` in
`src/lib/server/auth/auth-repository.ts`, and the enabled Resend outbox sends it
to the same current recipient. Thus completion produces two logical emails:
verification plus welcome. Prompt 04 permits only the verification delivery and
explicitly forbids other sends. Registration itself remains authorized, but
verification must wait for explicit authorization for that one additional
welcome delivery. This is a concrete permission-scope conflict, not a newly
demonstrated runtime P0/P1 or a reason to reopen the reviewed candidate. No code,
flag, secret, outbox row or provider configuration was changed to bypass it.

The owner-facing browser is at Cloudflare Access before the registration form.
The owner must complete Access and enter the first previously approved mailbox,
password and synthetic identity personally; credentials, OTP, cookies and
verification links must never enter chat or evidence. Submit the registration
once only. After the response and first delivery result, perform one bounded
read-only reconciliation and docs-only checkpoint **before** verification,
login or any further mutation. No resend or form retry on failure/ambiguity.

Protected current-user-only ignored evidence:
`tmp/first-registration-20260903-owner/before-safe.json` and
`before-counts-safe.json`; the former has SHA-256
`20ca94df4c72f2d5a61e0ddad974662b6ba05813ef007fbd2f8ef638366b13e0`.
The ignored helper
`tmp/first-registration-readonly.cjs` supports one observation per named stage
and only read-only control APIs/SELECT statements; it stores aggregate results,
never identity fields, token values or raw configuration. Two preliminary
helper invocations stopped on local evidence-directory ACL errors before their
control snapshot completed; no D1 or analytics observation was reached. The
successful preflight used a new directory created under the intended owner.
Do not run the retired historical registration snapshot helper.

Containment: keep Access and the two-recipient restriction unchanged; no
verification/welcome send until its scope is authorized; no direct D1 repair,
account deletion, automatic rollback or repeated diagnostics. If the owner
resumes outside this supervised window, revalidate stale preconditions once
before submitting. Permission for the one registration remains unused.

Validation: runtime, migrations, dependencies and config are unchanged from the
reviewed candidate; the full release evidence and independent GO above are
reused. This checkpoint uses only `npm run docs:check`, `npm run release:scan`
and `git diff --check`. Full check/Vitest/E2E/build/audit/review are not repeated.
`rollover_required: no`; `recommended_next_session_mode: High`: the authorized
registration write has a known target, procedure, postcondition and containment;
owner browser input and welcome scope must be respected.

## Exact Worker deploy checkpoint — 2026-09-03

Result: `success`. The one owner-authorized deploy was attempted at `15:46:37Z`;
the command completed at `15:47:39Z` with exit 0. The immediate read-only control check at
`15:47:58Z` confirmed the returned version fingerprint `ad3134edb662`, exact
candidate annotation and one active version at 100% traffic. All bindings,
runtime configuration class, existing feature gates and both Cron schedules
match the protected pre-deploy record. Anonymous and invalid Access probes
returned login redirects `302`; valid Access root returned `200`; the versioned
public route returned `404`. No retry or other remote mutation was performed.

The single bounded D1/cadence/health postcondition completed at `16:01:48Z`, after
waiting for the maintenance delivery without polling. Both fixed cadence rows
were fresh and `succeeded`, with zero recent failures: maintenance finished at
`16:00:49Z`, fast at `16:01:44Z`. Email claimed/sent counts were zero; Telegram
remained explicitly disabled. All seven maintenance jobs succeeded with no
business/storage work. This proves the scheduled deployment checkpoint, not the
separately gated Telegram/document/contract feature flows.

The ledger remains exact `0001`–`0026`, pending 0 and FK 0. The 13 SELECT
statements read 37 rows and wrote 0, with `changes=0` and `changed_db=false` for
every statement. Nine indexed latest-history seeks found no automatic rows
newer than `15:46:43Z`, before deploy completion; the retained ledger is no
longer growing. Users, sessions, auth tokens, bootstrap, email/Telegram outboxes,
Telegram delivery attempts and storage intents remain zero. One authenticated
health `HEAD` returned empty `204` with `no-store` and `noindex`. No unexpected
provider send or feature-gate weakening was observed.

The deploy permission is consumed. The only next action is to request separate
owner authorization for one controlled registration retry. Registration,
verification, provider send, bootstrap, rollback and feature/Access/secret changes
remain unauthorized. A later feature-flow failure alone does not justify
rolling back this successful Worker deployment.

Source proof: the primary worktree was clean at
`aa40dc766bc85e5158350a1abcf118f00d242615`, a docs-only descendant of the reviewed
candidate. A separate clean detached worktree at the exact candidate received
an offline `npm ci` from its unchanged lockfile; 274 installed packages were
verified. The protected preview config was copied byte-for-byte inside that
worktree. Wrangler resolved all 396 bundle inputs, the source entrypoint,
adapter output and assets inside it. Build and strict dry-run passed with
Wrangler `4.120.1`. Actual deploy and dry-run Worker bundles have the same SHA-256
`eef5af208fbe323060cda90ef4a949457480e54faaca6c7c1c9efa0295c5c92b`.

The bounded preflight at `15:45:25Z` reconfirmed migration ledger 26/pending 0,
FK 0, two idle cadence rows, no users/sessions/tokens/bootstrap/provider outbox/
storage-intent rows, Time Travel availability and unchanged protected target.
Its 13 SELECT statements read 37 rows and wrote 0; all reported
`changed_db=false`. Prior successful affected-table integrity evidence is reused.
One account-wide analytics observation showed 940,255 reads and 25,314 writes.

Protected, current-user-only evidence is under `tmp/worker-deploy-20260903/`;
full resource/version IDs, raw configuration and Time Travel bookmark remain
there. `success-safe.json` has SHA-256
`256863b209a03ec0e1c12e388affebcbccb0c8a704cd417fdf9ae76b3369a58b`.
The previous version fingerprint `745295d36248` is recorded as schema-
compatible through `0026`; it retains the old D1-cost P1. A rollback requires a
new explicit owner authorization and must preserve Access/provider containment.
`rollover_required: no`; `recommended_next_session_mode: High`: the next
controlled preview registration has known target/procedure and containment,
and requires its own permission for a remote write/provider delivery.

Validation for this checkpoint: exact detached build, strict dry-run and bounded
live pre/postconditions passed. Full `npm run check`, Vitest, Chromium E2E,
production dependency audit and independent GO are inherited from the unchanged
reviewed candidate above; none was repeated. The docs-only commit uses only
`npm run docs:check`, `npm run release:scan` and `git diff --check`. Production
readiness remains unchanged and blocked.

## Migration 0026 checkpoint — 2026-09-03

Result: `success`. The one owner-authorized remote mutation was attempted once on
the exact dedicated Access-protected preview D1 and applied only
`0026_background_d1_cost_controls.sql`. Wrangler executed its 15 statements in
132.34 ms and returned success. The conditional permission is consumed; no
Worker deploy, rollback, registration, bootstrap, provider send, Access/flag/var/
secret change, production/CMS action or real-PII action was performed.

The immediate single bounded `--command` postcondition was read-only throughout:
all statement metadata reported `changes=0`, `changed_db=false` and 0 rows
written. The migration ledger changed from exact `0001`–`0025` with only `0026`
pending to exact `0001`–`0026` with pending 0. Cadence state contains exactly the
`fast` and `maintenance` rows, both idle with fencing token 0. All 10 expected
table/index objects are present, both superseded indexes are absent, and foreign
key violations remain 0.

Retained-data counters remained valid: scheduled history increased naturally
from 80,667 to 80,692 rows while the old Cron Worker was still live; users,
contract actions/acceptances, price-review actions/acceptances and enrollments
remain 0; audit rows remain 5; legacy snapshot source rows remain 3,406; the two
bounded comparison groups remain 2 rows each. Table-scoped `quick_check` returned
`ok` for all 10 tables whose table/index structures the migration changes,
including the largest `scheduled_job_runs` table. The largest check read 242,076
rows and wrote 0; database size after the operation was 80,281,600 bytes.

The final preflight at `14:20:50Z` had reconfirmed clean candidate ancestry, no
runtime/migration/dependency/config drift, all protected target fingerprints,
the expected old Worker fingerprint at 100% traffic, Access redirect `302`, Time
Travel availability, restored daily D1 quota, and a pending set containing only
`0026`. Sanitized protected evidence is retained under
`tmp/d1-0026-20260903/`; `success-safe.json` has SHA-256
`bbf400e257850f394b3c35d829af6b6d887f08ae5362246cba47e76d4d2dce12`. Full
resource IDs, bookmarks and sensitive configuration remain outside tracked state.

The deployed old Worker still has `P1-DEPLOYED-D1-001`: the migration supplies
the compatible schema but does not itself stop cost-unbounded old health/Cron
paths. Containment therefore remains no health polling, registration, provider
send, bootstrap or other remote mutation. The only next action is to request
separate owner authorization for the exact reviewed Worker deploy and its one
bounded postcondition. `rollover_required: no`;
`recommended_next_session_mode: High`, because the exact target, reviewed
candidate, deploy procedure, postcondition and rollback/containment are known.

## Read-only integrity reconciliation checkpoint — 2026-09-03

Result: `success`; migration `0026` remains **not attempted**, and its conditional
permission is not consumed. The earlier database-wide `PRAGMA quick_check(1)`
failure is a bounded-execution limitation, not evidence of corruption. Cloudflare
documents `quick_check` as supported, but D1 query execution shares Workers CPU
and memory limits; SQLite documents the database-wide form as an O(N) scan. The
preview database currently has an approximately 80 MB logical image, 854 schema
objects and more than 80,000 retained scheduled-history rows.

The supported migration-specific integrity gate is now proven. Remote
`PRAGMA quick_check('scheduled_job_runs')` on the largest affected table returned
`ok` in 1.78 seconds with 241,848 reads and 0 writes. An isolated clean local D1
through `0026` then passed the exact command-path postcondition: ledger 26,
exactly two cadence rows, 10 required schema objects, 0 removed legacy indexes,
FK 0 and `ok` for table-scoped `quick_check` on all 10 tables whose table/index
structures `0026` changes. The remote postcondition must use `--command`, not
Wrangler's file-import path, so each result and `changed_db=false` remain visible.

Fresh control evidence at `14:07:48Z`–`14:12:14Z` confirms account-wide daily D1
usage of 357,811 reads and 23,055 writes, the unchanged protected config/target
fingerprints, the expected Worker fingerprint at 100% traffic, Access login
redirect `302` and an available Time Travel bookmark. Candidate ancestry,
runtime/migration/dependency/deploy-config equivalence and the reviewed `0026`
blob/hash remain unchanged.

One attempted SELECT-only precondition used `wrangler d1 execute --file`; Wrangler
reported 85,822 reads and 0 rows written, but also the contradictory transport
metadata `changed_db=true`. It is not accepted as evidence. The required single
query-path reconciliation immediately afterward returned ledger 25, no cadence
table, FK 0, 80,667 retained scheduled rows, `changes=0`, `changed_db=false` and
0 rows written. Therefore no logical schema/data mutation occurred, `0026` is
still pending and no recovery action is needed. Do not use `--file` for this
read-only checkpoint again.

Containment until the authorized write: no deploy, registration, provider send,
bootstrap, recovery or health polling. Immediately before apply, revalidate that
the Wrangler pending set is exactly `0026`; then apply it once and execute one
bounded `--command` ledger/schema/retention/FK/affected-table integrity
postcondition. `rollover_required: no`;
`recommended_next_session_mode: High`, because target, mutation, postcondition
and containment are exact and the contradictory read-path metadata was resolved
without a logical D1 write.

## Read-only preflight checkpoint — 2026-09-03

Result: `failed` preflight, **migration not attempted**. The owner invoked the
one-action prompt for `0026`; its conditional permission does not authorize a
write with an unavailable required integrity result. There was no remote
mutation attempt, provider send, Worker deploy or rollback in this session.

Before/after: live Worker fingerprint remains `745295d36248` at 100% traffic;
its D1 binding matches the protected preview target. Anonymous root returned an

HEAD `0f920d3762d9abfdcaddd5d54c93065a292776ba` is a docs-only descendant of the
reviewed candidate, with no runtime/migration/dependency/config diff. Migration
`0026` matches candidate blob `f105b6a2e36e0d3b6d1946864b182c38bd48be92` and
SHA-256 `167a319813f36e5f07e07ce3d75b33f588298cef951ba17ec1034fc122544e32`.

One account-wide Cloudflare analytics query at `13:12:27Z` confirmed daily usage
of 24,188 reads and 21,540 writes. Time Travel returned a pre-write bookmark at
`13:15:21Z`; it stays in protected evidence and was not restored. These are
timestamped observations, not a standing guarantee for a later write window.

Read-only D1 evidence confirms exact ledger `0001`–`0025`, only `0026` pending,
FK violations `0`, and 854 schema objects. Bounded baseline counters include
80,534 retained scheduled-job rows, 5 audit rows, 3,406 retained source rows,
2 target rows, 2 old-group rows and 0 users. The successful baseline read used
85,691 reads and 0 writes; no document bodies or client rows were retrieved.
Two earlier compound-SELECT forms received SQL compilation errors (`7500`);
the corrected separate SELECTs succeeded. Their evidence is retained, and the
completed data reads were reused without another data snapshot.

**Single blocker:** the one `PRAGMA quick_check(1)` attempt at `13:19:56Z`
returned `SQLITE_NOMEM`, API code `7500`, without an integrity result. This
reproduces the previously recorded verification limitation and does **not**
establish corruption. Applying the migration now could leave its mandatory
integrity postcondition unprovable; stop before write and reconcile that
verification capability read-only. Do not substitute FK-only evidence for the
owner's integrity requirement or retry the same failing check blindly.

Protected, Git-ignored evidence directory: `tmp/d1-0026-20260903/` (restricted
to the current Windows user). Relevant files: `control-preflight-safe.json`,
`quota-analytics.json`, `time-travel-before.json`,
`schema-before-no-compound.json`, `schema-full-before.json`,
`integrity-before.json` and `integrity-preflight-safe.json`. Full target IDs,
version IDs and the recovery bookmark are excluded from tracked state.

Containment: preserve Access and existing provider restrictions; no migration
retry, deploy, recovery write, registration or health/SQL/analytics polling.
The only next action is read-only reconciliation of the required bounded
integrity verification. `rollover_required: no`;
`recommended_next_session_mode: Medium`, because no write was attempted and
there is no ambiguous mutation or evidence of corruption requiring recovery.

## Sequencing constraint

Migration `0026` is schema-compatible with the currently deployed Worker, but it
does not make that old Worker cost-bounded. Therefore the migration checkpoint
must be followed by an immediate request for the separately authorized Worker
deploy in the same supervised window. Do not park the route while resuming health
or SQL polling; if the deploy permission is unavailable, preserve containment
and stop after the required migration postcondition/checkpoint.

## Test and review decision

The exact reviewed runtime candidate already has one full release gate and an
independent GO. Do not repeat either after this docs-only child or because of
`P2/P3`. A new full gate plus independent exact-candidate review is required only
for a material runtime, migration, dependency, deploy-config or genuinely
cross-cutting diff whose impact cannot be bounded by focused checks.

For a docs-only operational checkpoint run only the documentation/link/command
checks, release secret/PII scan and diff check. For a remote mutation run only the
exact-target preflight and bounded postcondition defined above.

## Update rule

After every attempted remote mutation, update **this file only** before the next
remote mutation. Update the large handoff only at a real phase/session boundary;
update production readiness only when a production gate changes; update
traceability only when requirement-to-evidence mapping changes. Do not copy the
current SHA, deployed fingerprint or next action into those documents.
